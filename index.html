      <h1>Just who is Jordan Van Ness?</h1>
      <p>Washingtonian  -  20something  -  3d artist  -  musician  -  programmer (maybe)</p>
    </header>

    <main>
      <h2>Bio:</h2>
      <p>On November 21, 1992... Louise Karlsson set the world swimming record
      for the 50m butterfly. But on the next day, Jordan was born. Since then,
      Jordan has been doing things. With a passion for music, puzzles,
      role-playing games, and floral shirts, Jordan hopes to accomplish things
      that let him make a meaningful contribution to the world and help others.
      Jordan is from the very green and very rainy state of Washington. He has
      lived there for 20 years out of the 24 years he has been alive, and doesn't
      plan on stopping. He pretty much likes it there, I guess. Go figure. Jordan
      is typically found at his computer either wasting time browsing the web,
      listening to seemingly intentionally bad music, or making characters for
      role-playing games that act as a quick-dry cement for his reputation of
      nerdiness.</p>

      <h2>Education and Experience Timeline:</h2>

      </ul>
